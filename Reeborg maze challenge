## Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flash light ran out. Writing a program to help Reeborg find exit. 
# The secret is to make Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze. 
# Turning right if it can. Going straight if it cant turn rightor turning left as its last resort.

#defining function turn_right
def turn_right():
    turn_left
    turn_left
    turn_left

while not at_goal():  # at_goal is at the winning point
    if  right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear:
        move()
    else:
        turn_left
